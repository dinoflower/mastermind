# Mastermind

A simple terminal-based version of my favorite guessing game, playable against the computer as codemaker or codebreaker.

Requires Ruby and is playable in the command line or on [replit](https://replit.com/@dinoflower/Mastermind-Simple?v=1).

## Installation

You may clone the repo from here on github! This version is not available in the style of a Ruby Gem due to its simplicity.

## Usage

Simply run:

    $ ruby mastermind/lib/main.rb

Additional navigation may be necessary depending on the save location of the repository. No additional commands required - the game will load on start.

You can also play the game on [replit](https://replit.com/@dinoflower/Mastermind-Simple?v=1)

## Future Updates

The computer is, unfortunately, not very smart. I intend to improve its ability to guess the secret code in a later release.
